> Connecting Remote Offices via Gamified Touchless Phygital Interfaces

Bridge Space creates a link between remote offices through gamified touchless phygital interfaces. This device utilizes sensors as interactive components and a display screen, and the system is tailored for office environments. The design emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, and gamified features to enhance user engagement.

Starting with human-device interactions, it facilitates seamless communication between devices and extends to connect office workers in different locations. Through these interfaces, activities, and messages are shared between offices, bridging the physical gap between remote offices and fostering a sense of connection among office workers.

## ðŸª¬ Sense
